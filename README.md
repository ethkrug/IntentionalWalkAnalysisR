# IntentionalWalkAnalysisR

This project explored the impact of an intentional walk on the subsequent hitterâ€™s plate appearance in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Performance of players who batted immediately following intentional walks was analyzed and compared to those who did not follow an intentional walk during the 2024 MLB season.
The analysis aimed to provide insight into the psychological impact of an intentional walk. The act of a team deliberately avoiding one hitter in favor of facing the next can serve as significant motivation for the second hitter. The statistical differences in performance between these hitters and those not batting after an intentional walk were used to quantify this potential psychological effect.

**Metrics Analyzed**

To compare the two groups, On-base Percentage (OBP), Slugging Percentage (SLG), Runs Created (RC), plate appearances per home run, and plate appearances per strikeout were examined. T-tests were conducted to determine statistical significance, and differences in On-base Plus Slugging (OPS) were also analyzed.

**Additional Factors Influencing Performance**

Several factors beyond psychological differences may explain the performance gap between hitters following intentional walks and others:

Game Context: Intentional walks typically occur with at least one runner on base, often placing runners in scoring position. In these situations, pitchers tend to adjust their strategy to focus on inducing ground ball outs, which can lead to giving up hard-hit balls.
Pitching Approach: With runners on base, pitchers often adopt less aggressive strategies, emphasizing corners of the strike zone and off-speed pitches to avoid hard contact. These adjustments can create more hitter-friendly counts and result in more walks compared to situations with no runners on base.
Mechanics: Pitchers use a "stretch" delivery with runners on base, which can reduce velocity and accuracy. These mechanical changes may make it easier for hitters to succeed.

While these factors provide plausible explanations for some performance differences, they do not account for all observed gaps. Some discrepancies were significant enough to suggest the influence of psychological factors beyond these hypotheses. This project explored the potential for such psychological impacts on hitters' performance.
